            <p>Hi! my name is Dez. I'm in the WEBDEV-114 Web Development with HMTL and CSS. 
                I keep saying this as a joke, but I just really want to learn how to make a pixelated cat turn around in circles. 
                I know that's probably not HTML, but I do think it would be cool. Otherwise I just want to learn how to do code enough to make my own website. </p>
                <p>I used to play with my HTML when I had a tumblr, but that was many years ago! Maybe my final project can be my art portfolio! I'm not sure how far I will get with making a full blown websitte, but the information is what's important!</p>
